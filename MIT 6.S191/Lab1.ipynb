Layers are fully connected to the next. As the network gets deeper, it's expressive power grows exponentially and so they can draw some pretty fancy decision boundaries. In this exercise, you'll build your own MLP, with 2 hidden layers (layers that aren't input or output).\n",

All these functions take a list argument that determines their shape. Here we use tf.truncated_normal for our weights, and tf.zeros for our biases. Its important that the shape of these parameters are compatible. We’ll be matrix-multiplying the weights, so the last dimension of the previous weight matrix must equal the first dimension of the next weight matrix. Notice this pattern in the following tensor initialization code. Lastly, notice the size of the tensor for our last weights. We are predicting a vector of size n_classes so our network needs to end with n_classes nodes."

Using batches is just like Stochastic Gradient Descent, except instead of updating parameters after each example, we update them based on the gradient computed after *several* examples.\n",

However, given that we optimized our hyper-parameters to the development set, to get a true fair assesment of the model, we test it with respect to a held-out test set at the end, and generally report those numbers.\n",

As an additional exercise, you can see what you can do with this code to improve the performance. Ideas include: randomizing mini-batches, making the network deeper, using word embeddings (see below) rather than bag-of-words, trying different optimizers (like Adam), different weight initializations. We’ll explore some of these tomorrow.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this lab we used Bag-of-Words to represent a tweet.  Word Embeddings are a more meaningful representation.  The basic idea is we represent a word with a vector $\\phi$ by the context the word appears in. We do this by training a neural network to predict the context of words across a large training set. The weights of that neural network can then be thought of as a dense and useful representation that captures context. This is useful because now our representations of words captures actual semantic similarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Word Embeddings capture all kinds of useful semantic relationships. For example, one cool emergent property is $ \\phi(king) - \\phi(queen) = \\phi(man) - \\phi(woman)$. To learn more about the magic behind word embeddings we recommend Chris Olah's [blog post](https://colah.github.io/posts/2014-07-NLP-RNNs-Representations/). A common tool for generating Word Embeddings is word2vec."
